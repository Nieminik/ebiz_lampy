Far ahead of its competitors, our module is recommended by the largest e-commerce agencies, on the one hand for its simplicity of configuration and on the other hand for the guarantee of exporting to Google Merchant Center a high quality data feed that meets all Google&#39;s requirements.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>We started from a simple observation: the performance of your Google Shopping ads depends largely on the completeness of the product feed data. The more information you send, the better the results! This&nbsp;<strong>comprehensive<\/strong>&nbsp;module allows you to&nbsp;<strong>maximize your chances of getting good rankings on Google Shopping<\/strong>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<strong>minimizing the time<\/strong>&nbsp;you need to invest in order to achieve this result.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>The module has been developed to allow you to create, step by step, a product data feed for which you are in control of the information. We have included, throughout the configuration, links to precise and complete documentation based on Google&#39;s official regulations. You quickly get a clear product data file that you can export to Google Merchant Center and which you can schedule to be updated automatically at the desired frequency.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Any questions?

The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/><br \/>The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together.

The stock import function in PrestaShop is quite confusing and includes a minimum of functions. A functional, quick and convenient method of products management is a perfect choice for a modern state of the online store. Our Product Catalog Import module allows you to easily import and update your product catalog. It allows you to extend the initial import functionality and can be easily configured in a few steps.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Our main product advantages which we are proud of:<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Automatic import feature with an email notification<\/strong>&nbsp;- allows to configure automatic import and get the report about it on your email address.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Multiple images import &amp; thumbnails generation<\/strong>&nbsp;- allows importing product images by 2 methods: Images in one field separated by a comma or Each image in a separate field.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Combinations import methods<\/strong>&nbsp;- combination in one field, each attribute and value in the separate field, each combination in a separate row in the file, generate combinations from attribute values.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Categories import<\/strong>&nbsp;by category name, category ID or category

this module allows you to do that by <strong>increasing the shipping process by 70%. <\/strong><br \/><br \/>Think of how long it takes to receive an order from your customers, process the order by adding the products to the package, then connect to your shipping carrier`s software and manually insert the customer information, parcel information and delivery address for the order, for each order at a time. This is very time consuming and it`s very easy to make mistakes because you have a lot of data to process.<br \/><br \/>With this module all of this is done automatically via the API (Application Programming Interface) that connects the orders section in prestashop with the carrier and instantly sends the information to the carrier, then prints the shipping label which is then slicked to the package.
